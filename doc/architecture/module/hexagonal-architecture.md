### Hexagonal Architecture: Domain Modules with Ports
In a Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters), each domain module should encapsulate not only its core data structures and logic but also the ports (traits) it depends on. For example, the Engine struct and its implementation of the `car::Engine` trait are kept within the same module. This design promotes modular boundaries, where the domain remains decoupled from external systems while still clearly expressing its dependencies.

Keeping the data (Engine), behavior (trait implementation), and ports (`car::Engine`, `car::Result`) together within the domain module improves discoverability, reduces cross-module navigation, and ensures that the domain logic can be reasoned about in isolation. It also supports testability, as the adapters (infrastructure-side implementations of the ports) can be substituted independently. Exposing the default or primary type `car::Car` at the module level reinforces a clean and intentional module interface, aligning with the principle of exposing only what the domain truly owns or depends on.

```rust
pub struct Engine;

impl car::Engine for Engine {
    fn vroom(&self) -> car::Result<&'static str> {
        "vroom"
    }
}

fn main() {
    let car: car::Car = car::Car::default();
}
```
