### Imports
The preferred import style emphasizes clarity and consistency by aligning import paths directly with their usage. In the case of use `::serde`, followed by referencing `serde::Serialize` and `serde::Deserialize` in the derive macros, this keeps the connection to the original crate explicit and avoids potential name collisions or ambiguity that may arise when importing specific symbols. It also makes it easier to grep for usages across a codebase.

###### Yes
```rust
use ::serde;

#[derive(serde::Serialize)]
#[derive(serde::Deserialize)]
struct Foo;

```

###### No
```rust
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Serialize)]
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct Foo;
```

Similarly, use `crate::shape::circle` is favored over importing a broader module like shape because it reduces namespace clutter and leads to more concise and readable code within the module. It clearly communicates intent by importing only what is needed, aiding in code maintainability and minimizing cognitive overhead when navigating or refactoring.

###### Yes
```rust
use crate::shape::circle;

fn main() {
    let circle: circle::Circle = circle::Circle::default();
}
```

###### No
```rust
use crate::shape;

fn main() {
    let circle: shape::circle::Circle = shape::circle::Circle::default();
}
```
