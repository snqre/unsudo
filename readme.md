The workspace exposes central dependencies with versions of stable builds of each internal dependency. If a specific crate requires a different version of a crate, it can do so but that is not preferred. The public projects are automatically up to date with all changes from the workpace's internal crates, change the version and republish when certain crates have changed. Public crates reexport internal crates, and must start with the `unsudo` namespace.
